Today is 10 Jan 2023
Time now in 3 am.

This text file marks the end of my journey of learning basic C.
Now, All I have to do is learn more and improve myself and be a better programmer.

I am gonna be admitted in JKKNIU today too. 
I have finished my C-basic before admitting to an university.
I have to remember that I left every top uni of Bangladesh just to get CSE.
I have Sacrificed EVERYTHING to get this CSE.


So, this is a message to me and my future self:
Don't you slack off. 
Don't you forget everything you have lost.
Don't you get washed away by other things.
Don't you take your mind of CSE and study.

Remember, you are on a mission.
A mission to regain everything you lost.
A mission to regain everything you could have got.
A mission to regain the respect you lost.

A mission to show the world what are you made of.
A mission to show that you are you...

May Allah help me finding my path to that.
Adios.
